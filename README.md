## Documentation

### Installing SBT
* [Mac OS X](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html#mac)
  * Homebrew is recommended
* [Windows](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html#installing-sbt)
* [Linux - Gentoo](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html#gentoo)

### IntelliJ IDEA
This Blank project contains SBT plugin **gen-idea** that allows you to generate IDEA's project files.

We suggest you **change the name of the project** in the `build.sbt` file after you clone the repository. 
Start SBT and run following command:

```
> sbt
sbt> gen-idea no-sbt-build-module
```

Then you can open the project using IDEA as you are used to. The most important things should already be setup.

### Eclipse
You will need the [Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/) plugin to work with Scala projects in your Eclipse.
We recommend the latest [milestone release](http://scala-ide.org/download/milestone.html) of Scala IDE 2.1.0.

This Blank project contains SBT plugin [sbteclipse](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbteclipse/wiki/Using-sbteclipse)
that allows you to generate Eclipse project definitions.

We suggest you **change the name of the project** in the `build.sbt` file after you clone the repository (otherwise the name of the project would be `blank`).

After that, start SBT and run the following command:

```
> sbt
sbt> eclipse
```

This will create an Eclipse project that you can import into your workspace.

### REPL
SBT contains a nice command `console` which allows firing up a REPL (Scala console) with the **project on classpath**.
That means that you can interactively try your code.

```
> sbt
sbt> console
scala> import com.blank._
scala> Hello.sayHello
```
